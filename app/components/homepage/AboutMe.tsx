        I am Mehmet Yıldız, an IT specialist hailing from Turkey with a fervent
        passion for all things tech. My journey in tech started back in 2000
        when I first had my own computer. By middle school, I was already diving
        into Photoshop and video editing alongside gaming, nurturing my passion
        for both creative and technical pursuits. It has been a thrilling
        adventure, blending my love for problem-solving, creativity, and the
        perpetual quest for knowledge.

        I have a degree in History of Sciences from university, during my
        master&apos;s, I got my first taste of web development by creating a
        website as requested from my institution. This experience sparked a
        newfound love for crafting digital experiences, leading me to develop
        websites for other academic organizations and businesses. My interest in
        data science grew as well, envisioning how machine learning could
        revolutionize the analysis of historical manuscripts.

        The pandemic led to a pivotal change in my career path. I decided to
        leave my master&apos;s program and started working as a freelance
        webmaster, providing web administration, design, and digital identity
        services for a branding agency. I then worked as an IT Support
        Specialist for a leading boiler manufacturer, handling daily staff
        support, digital administration, and various technical tasks. These
        include server management, translating 3D printing software, and even
        web scraping for potential client data.
